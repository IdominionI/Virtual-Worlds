This is a revised and redesigned updated version of the original Virtual Worlds prototype. 

Same concepts applied for generating and displying HCP Voxels but using the OpenFrameWork as a basis for the application, but with some modifications where neccesary.

The OpenFramWorks files that have had modifications and have been added to the Openframeworks directory structure are included in the directory libs/Openframworks
